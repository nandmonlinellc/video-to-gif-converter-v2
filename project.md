# **Project Requirements Document: The Ultimate GIF Maker**

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements for enhancing the Video to GIF Converter website.

### **Core Functional Requirements**

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR001 | Video File Upload | As a user, I want to upload a video file from my device so I can convert it into a GIF. | The system provides a clear "upload" or drag-and-drop area. It supports common video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, WEBM). |
| FR002 | Basic GIF Conversion | As a user, I want the system to convert my uploaded video into a high-quality animated GIF. | After uploading a video, the system processes it and generates a GIF that is displayed on the page. |
| FR003 | GIF Download | As a user, I want to be able to download the generated GIF to my device. | A "Download" button is provided. Clicking it prompts the user to save the `.gif` file to their local machine. |
| FR004 | Recent Creations History | As a user, I want to see a history of my most recently created GIFs on the page so I can easily access them again. | The system displays thumbnails of the last 5 GIFs created during the session, with links to view or download them. |

### **Advanced Editing & Enhancement Features**

| FR005 | Precise Time Selection | As a user, I want to specify the exact start and end times of the video clip to be converted. | The interface provides input fields for "Start Time" and "End Time" in seconds. |
| FR006 | FPS Control | As a user, I want to adjust the Frames Per Second (FPS) of the GIF to balance file size and smoothness. | A dropdown or slider allows selecting from a range of FPS options (e.g., 10, 15, 24). |
| FR007 | Visual Cropping | As a user, I want to visually crop the video frame to focus on a specific area. | The system displays a frame from the video with an adjustable crop box. |
| FR008 | Resolution & Resizing | As a user, I want to change the output resolution of the GIF to make it suitable for different platforms. | A dropdown allows selecting output widths (e.g., Original, 480px, 320px). |
| FR009 | Playback Speed Control | As a user, I want to change the playback speed of my GIF to create slow-motion or fast-forward effects. | A dropdown provides options for playback speed (e.g., 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2.0x). |
| FR010 | **Text Overlay** | **As a user, I want to add text over my GIF to create captions or memes.** | **The user can input text and select a font, size, and color. The system also provides options to set the text's position (e.g., top, bottom, center, top-left), a background color for the text box, a stroke (outline) color and width, and a drop shadow effect.** |
| FR011 | **Image/Logo Overlay** | **As a branding user, I want to add a watermark or logo to my GIF.** | **The user can upload a small image (e.g., a PNG with transparency) and position it on the GIF.** |
| FR012 | **GIF Reverse / Boomerang**| **As a creative user, I want to reverse my GIF or create a "boomerang" effect.** | **A checkbox or option allows the final GIF to play backward or to play forward and then immediately backward.** |
| FR013 | **Visual Filters** | **As a user, I want to apply visual filters like 'Grayscale' or 'Sepia' to my GIF.** | **A selection of preset filters can be applied to change the look and feel of the GIF.** |
| FR014 | **Rotation and Flipping**| **As a user, I want to rotate or flip a video that was recorded in the wrong orientation.** | **Buttons are available to rotate the video 90 degrees or flip it horizontally/vertically before conversion.** |

| FR016 | **Live Editing Preview**| **As a user, I want to see a live preview of my edits before I start the conversion.** | **As the user changes options (cropping, text, filters), a static preview image updates to show what the final GIF will look like.** |
